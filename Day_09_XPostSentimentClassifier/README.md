# Day 9: X Sentiment Classifier

Welcome to Day 9 of your AI projects journey! This script fetches tweets from X (Twitter) using the X API v2, preprocesses the text using NLTK, and analyzes the sentiment using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Learning Keys
- Advanced Twitter API integration
- Text preprocessing with NLTK (tokenization and lemmatization)
- Sentiment analysis with VADER for social media text
- Handling environment variables and virtual environments for secure API credentials

## Setup
1. Ensure Python is installed (see `../setup_guide.md`).
2. In the root directory, activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows).
3. Move into the correct working directory by running `cd Day_09_XPostSentimentClassifier`.
4. Install required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
